# pos-toolkit

Building blocks for point-of-sale applications, by [Nari Solutions](https://github.com/narisolutions). Extracted from our POS products, among them [medusa-pos](https://github.com/narisolutions/medusa-pos); built for them, usable by anyone. Apache-2.0.

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`plugins/pos-hardware`](plugins/pos-hardware) | Tauri v2 plugin + Rust library: ESC/POS printing (network / USB / Windows spooler), cash-drawer kick, USB printer enumeration, physical/virtual keyboard handling, **serial (Virtual COM) scanners**, **USB HID POS scales** |
| `packages/register-core` *(planned)* | Cash-register / reconciliation core (TypeScript): business-day logic, expected-cash math, session state machine |
| [`packages/receipt-builder`](packages/receipt-builder) | Receipt text builder (TypeScript): a fully host-composed document in (header/meta/items/totals/payments/footer), fixed-width printer text out. Paper widths 80mm/57mm, printer-safe encodings (ascii/utf8/cp852), amounts opaque through a host `formatAmount` |

## Consuming

- **Rust** (`plugins/*`): git dependency until crates.io publishing is set up — `tauri-plugin-pos-hardware = { git = "https://github.com/narisolutions/pos-toolkit" }`. The optional `specta` feature derives `specta::Type` on the wire types for tauri-specta hosts.
- **TypeScript** (`packages/*`): npm can't target a subdirectory of a git dependency, so until npm publishing is set up the repo root is itself an npm package that re-exports each TS package as raw source under a subpath: `npm install github:narisolutions/pos-toolkit`, then `import { buildReceiptText } from "@narisolutions/pos-toolkit/receipt-builder"`. Your bundler/tsconfig must handle TS source in node_modules (Vite does).

## HID POS scales

`scale::list_hid_scales` lists HID devices with the ones on the POS usage page
(0x8D) first; `scale::open_scale` attaches a reader that decodes the class's
Scale Data Report — status, unit, a signed exponent, a 16-bit weight — into an
integer number of thousandths of the reported unit and emits it on
`pos-hardware://scale-reading` whenever it changes (and on a heartbeat while it
does not). One generic driver, because the report is standardised across
Mettler Toledo, Datalogic, Zebra and the small counter scales; the module never
prices, never converts a unit and never decides whether a reading may be sold.
On Linux the device is a root-only `hidraw` node until a udev rule says
otherwise, and the open error says which rule.

## Serial scanners, and why they are worth the port

A barcode scanner in its default mode is a **keyboard wedge**: it synthesises
keystrokes, the OS resolves them through the active keyboard layout, and the
application reads them out of whatever field has focus. That is three problems
at once — the layout rewrites the payload, the scan lands wherever focus
happens to be, and injection is slow enough to be visible on a 2D code.

Switching the scanner to Virtual COM (a configuration barcode on every scanner
we have met, usually labelled "USB Virtual COM", "USB-COM" or "CDC") replaces
all three with bytes on a port. `serial::open_scanner` attaches a reader and
emits one `pos-hardware://serial-scan` per framed message; framing is CR, LF or
CRLF, with an idle fallback for devices that terminate nothing.

The failure that motivated it: a Tera HW0009 with a US HID country code against
a Swedish host delivered `https://…?d=` as `httpsÖ--…_dé`, losing a character
outright to a dead key. None of that is reachable over a serial port.

**Linux hosts need the user in the serial group** — `uucp` on Arch/Manjaro,
`dialout` on Debian/Ubuntu — and that is the commonest reason a correctly
configured scanner looks dead, so `serial::open_error_hint` turns the bare
"Permission denied" into the sentence that fixes it.

## Design rules

- Packages take **no product-specific dependencies**: the hardware plugin takes bytes and device addresses, the register core takes a sales-source adapter, the receipt builder takes a plain struct.
- The Rust plugin exposes its core as **plain library functions** as well as Tauri commands — hosts may embed it library-style and keep their own command surface.
- Built and maintained for Nari's POS products; issues and PRs welcome, support promises modest.
